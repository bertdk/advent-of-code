# Advent Of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.
I will be using this as an opportunity to compare different languages.

Currently, I am using the following languages (navigate to the folder before running commands):

- TypeScript
  - Setup: `pnpm` + `tsconfig.json`
  - Run: `pnpm exec ts-node src/2020/01/2023day01.ts`
- Dotnet
  - Setup: [dotnet-script](https://github.com/dotnet-script/dotnet-script) + [Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
  - Run: go to directory containing script and run `dotnet script 2023day01.csx`
- Python
  - Setup: `python3` + [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
  - Run: go to directory containing script and run `python3 2023day01.py`
- PHP
  - Setup: `brew install php`
  - Run: go to directory containing script and run `php app.php`
